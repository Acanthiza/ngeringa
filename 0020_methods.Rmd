# Methods

## Surveys

Surveys occurred in the morning on one day in spring. Survey were occurred in each of `r length(unique(lubridate::year(dat$Date)))` years: `r envFunc::vec_to_sentence(unique(lubridate::year(dat$Date)))`.

All individual birds were recorded directly into [Avenza](https://store.avenza.com/pages/app-features).

## Analysis



## Workflow

The data import, cleaning, analysis and report writing were done in a scripted workflow using the programs `R` and 'R-studio Desktop'. [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) [@R-base] is an open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Base R can be extended via a range of open source packages to enable specific tasks or analyses. The packages used to produce this report are listed in Table \@ref(tab:packages).

[R-studio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is a set of open source tools built to facilitate interaction with `R`.

```{r packages}

  knitr::kable(tibble::tibble(package = packages) %>%
                 dplyr::mutate(citation = paste0("@R-"
                                                 , package
                                                 )
                               ) %>%
                 dplyr::left_join(tibble::as_tibble(devtools::session_info(include_base = TRUE)$packages)) %>%
                 dplyr::select(package
                               , citation
                               , loadedversion
                               , date
                               , source
                               )
               , caption = "R [@R-base] packages used in the production of this report"
               )
